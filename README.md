### Description
Town planner is a city building/resource managment web game built with Javascript and WEBGL,
made for a university course in computer graphics at FRI.

Inspired by SimCity and Cities: Skylines, Town Planner is a simplified version of the previously mentioned.
The objective of the game is to build up your city as much as possible while keeping your people happy.
If the happiness level drops below 15% you lose the game.

There are a couple of buildings for you to place on the 30x30 map.
<!-- TABLE OF CONTENTS -->
<details>
  <summary>Buildings</summary>
  <ol>
    <li>House - 2 pop</li>
    <li>Factory - 30 goods</li>
    <li>Shop - 10 income</li>
    <li>Wind turbine - 100 energy</li>
    <li>Road</li>
    <li>Town hall</li>
  </ol>
</details>

Each building provides the town with certain resources but also require other resources to build it.

The game was made with the intention of being relaxing and not too stresfull, that is why we also included
some calming and relaxing Bossa nova jazz music.

So before playing the game get yourself a cup of tea and enjoy as you see your little town grow.
